    "\n",
    "In the previous module, we built a RAG pipeline from scratch. We learned about the core components: document loaders, splitters, embedding models, vector stores, and LLMs. While building from scratch provides a deep understanding, it's not always the most efficient way to build production systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where **LangChain** comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain is a powerful framework for developing applications powered by language models. It provides a standard, extensible interface and a rich library of components that can be \"chained\" together to create sophisticated AI workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will take our first steps with LangChain. We will learn its fundamental building blocks and use the **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)** to compose them into our first real pipeline. This \"chain\" will form the foundation of the Manufacturing Copilot, a tool designed to provide instant, accurate answers to technicians on the factory floor."

    "2.  **Master LangChain Expression Language (LCEL):** Use the `|` (pipe) operator to compose components into a declarative, runnable pipeline.\n",

    "## 🧱 Step 2: The Three Core Components of a LangChain Chain\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, a LangChain pipeline, or \"chain,\" is composed of three fundamental building blocks. Understanding these is the key to mastering LangChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **The `PromptTemplate`**: This is the blueprint for the instructions given to the LLM. It's a template that combines user input with fixed instructions to create a complete, precise prompt. This ensures that every query is sent to the LLM in a consistent and well-structured format.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **The Model (`ChatOpenAI`)**: This is the \"brain\" of the operation. It can be a large language model (LLM) or a chat model. We'll use `ChatOpenAI` to connect to OpenAI's powerful models like GPT-4o-mini. LangChain provides dozens of integrations, so you can easily swap this component for a different model from Hugging Face, Anthropic, or Google.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **The `OutputParser`**: This component takes the raw output from the LLM and transforms it into a more usable format. The simplest parser, `StrOutputParser`, takes the LLM's response and converts it into a clean string. More advanced parsers can convert the output into structured data like JSON or Python objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will compose these three components using the **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)**, which uses the pipe `|` symbol. This creates a declarative, elegant, and powerful way to define our AI pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "`chain = prompt | model | output_parser`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build our first chain."

    "In a real-world manufacturing environment, simply getting an answer isn't enough. For compliance, safety, and quality control (e.g., under ISO 9001 standards), it's crucial to maintain a record of the AI's operations. Who asked what? What information was used? How long did it take?\n",

    "\n",
    "You've learned about the three core components—**Prompts, Models, and Output Parsers**—and how to compose them into a powerful, declarative chain using the **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)**. You also took a critical first step towards production-readiness by implementing a **governance wrapper** to create an audit trail of your chain's activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "-   **Composition is Key:** LCEL's pipe `|` syntax is the heart of modern LangChain development. It allows you to build complex logic in a simple, readable way.\n",
    "-   **Components are Swappable:** The modular nature of LangChain means you can easily swap out any component. You could change the `model` to one from Google or Hugging Face without altering the rest of your chain.\n",
    "-   **Governance is Not an Afterthought:** Building logging and auditing into your process from the beginning is essential for creating responsible and reliable AI applications.\n",
