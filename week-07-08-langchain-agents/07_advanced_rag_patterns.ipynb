    "# 🔍 Week 07-08 · Notebook 07: Advanced RAG - Retrievers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Move beyond basic similarity search and build sophisticated, multi-stage retrieval pipelines that deliver more accurate and context-aware results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, we built a basic retrieval system: we indexed documents in a vector store and used similarity search to find relevant chunks. While this is a great start, it often falls short in real-world scenarios. User questions can be ambiguous, and simple vector similarity doesn't always capture the true relevance of a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced RAG** introduces more sophisticated techniques to improve the \"Retrieval\" step. A better retriever leads to a better final answer from the LLM. In this notebook, we will focus on the **Retriever** component itself and explore several powerful patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Multi-Query Retriever:** Tackles ambiguity by generating multiple variations of a user's question from different perspectives.\n",
    "2.  **Parent Document Retriever:** Solves the \"lost-in-the-middle\" problem by retrieving small, precise chunks but providing the larger parent document to the LLM for better context.\n",
    "3.  **Re-ranking:** Adds a secondary sorting step to the retrieved results, applying custom business logic or a more powerful model to improve the final ranking."

    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Implement a Multi-Query Retriever:** Use an LLM to automatically generate and run multiple search queries to improve recall.\n",
    "2.  **Use the Parent Document Retriever:** Structure your data to retrieve small chunks but return their parent documents for improved LLM context.\n",
    "3.  **Apply a Re-ranking Step:** Implement a custom re-ranking function to sort retrieved documents based on specific business heuristics (e.g., prioritizing safety alerts).\n",
    "4.  **Understand the Trade-offs:** Compare and contrast these advanced techniques with basic similarity search."

    "## 🧩 Scenario: Improving the Maintenance Chatbot's Retrieval Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "The maintenance chatbot is live, but technicians are reporting some issues. A vague query like *\"spindle vibrating\"* sometimes misses critical safety alerts or fails to find the root cause from past incidents. A simple similarity search isn't enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to upgrade the retrieval system to be more robust and intelligent. You will implement and test three advanced patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  When a technician asks, *\"Why is the spindle vibrating?\"*, you'll use a **Multi-Query Retriever** to also search for related concepts like *\"causes of spindle vibration\"* and *\"troubleshooting high spindle vibration\"*.\n",
    "2.  You'll use a **Parent Document Retriever** to ensure that when a small, relevant sentence from a long SOP is found, the LLM receives the full section for complete context.\n",
    "3.  Finally, you'll add a **re-ranking** step that explicitly boosts the score of any retrieved document containing \"Safety-Alert\" or \"Incident\", ensuring that critical information always appears first."
