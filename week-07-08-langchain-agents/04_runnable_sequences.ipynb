    "### Beyond Linear Chains: Orchestrating Complex Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've built simple, linear chains: `prompt | model | parser`. But real-world applications are rarely so straightforward. They need to handle multiple steps, execute tasks in parallel, and, most importantly, be resilient to failure. What happens if a database connection drops? Or an API call times out?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the full power of the **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)** shines. LCEL is more than just a way to pipe components together; it's a complete language for orchestrating complex, non-linear workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore advanced LCEL concepts to build robust and resilient AI systems. We will learn how to:\n",
    "-   Execute different parts of our chain in parallel.\n",
    "-   Create fallback mechanisms to handle errors gracefully.\n",
    "-   Implement a \"Circuit Breaker\" pattern to prevent cascading failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques are essential for moving from simple prototypes to production-grade applications that can withstand the unpredictability of the real world."

    "1.  **Orchestrate Non-Linear Steps with `RunnableParallel`:** Construct chains where multiple operations (like retrieval and data formatting) can run in parallel.\n",
    "2.  **Implement Resilient Fallbacks:** Use the `.with_fallbacks()` method to create chains that can gracefully handle errors by trying alternative paths.\n",
    "3.  **Create Custom Logic with `RunnableLambda`:** Wrap any Python function into a reusable LCEL component.\n",

    "Imagine you are building a financial services chatbot. Your customers expect fast, accurate answers to their questions. However, the primary Large Language Model (LLM) you use might occasionally fail due to high traffic, API rate limits, or other transient issues.\n",

    "1.  **Tries the primary, high-performance model first.**\n",
    "2.  **If the primary model fails, it automatically switches to a reliable secondary model.**\n",
    "3.  **If both models fail repeatedly, it triggers a \"circuit breaker\"** to stop sending requests for a short period, preventing further errors and allowing the system to recover.\n",

    "2.  **Open State:** If the failure count exceeds a threshold within a certain time, the circuit \"opens.\" All subsequent requests are immediately rejected without even trying, preventing further load on the failing service.\n",
    "3.  **Half-Open State:** After a timeout period, the circuit moves to a \"half-open\" state. It allows a single request to pass through. If it succeeds, the circuit closes and returns to normal. If it fails, the circuit opens again.\n",
