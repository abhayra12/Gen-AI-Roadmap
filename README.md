## ‚ùì FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need a GPU to run this course?</strong></summary>

**No!** This course uses **HuggingFace Inference API**, which runs models in the cloud. You only need a CPU and internet connection. See [00_huggingface_setup.ipynb](./00_huggingface_setup.ipynb) for setup.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this course suitable for complete beginners?</strong></summary>

**Yes!** We rated this course **9.0/10 for beginners**. Week 1-2 covers Python and ML fundamentals. If you can write basic Python (variables, functions), you can start. See [BEGINNER_ASSESSMENT.md](./BEGINNER_ASSESSMENT.md) for detailed breakdown.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How much does this cost?</strong></summary>

- **Course materials**: Free (MIT License)
- **HuggingFace API**: Free tier available (sufficient for learning)
- **Cloud deployment**: GCP free tier covers basic deployment
- **Total**: $0 to get started, <$50 for full production deployment
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use OpenAI instead of HuggingFace?</strong></summary>

**Yes!** The course is designed for HuggingFace (no GPU needed), but most notebooks can be adapted to use OpenAI APIs. You'll need to modify initialization code. See individual notebook READMEs for guidance.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How long does it take to complete?</strong></summary>

**12 weeks at 8-10 hours/week** for full completion. However:
- **Fast track**: 6 weeks at 20 hours/week
- **Part-time**: 6 months at 3-4 hours/week
- **Just capstone**: 2 weeks if you have LLM experience

Progress at your own pace!
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Will this get me a job?</strong></summary>

This course provides **production-ready skills** and a **portfolio project**. Many Gen AI engineer roles require:
- ‚úÖ LLM fine-tuning (Week 9-10)
- ‚úÖ RAG implementation (Week 5-6)
- ‚úÖ Agent orchestration (Week 7-8)
- ‚úÖ Production deployment (Week 11-12)

You'll learn all of this! However, landing a job also requires networking, interview prep, and soft skills.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I contribute to this course?</strong></summary>

**Yes!** Contributions welcome:
