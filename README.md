## 🏭 Capstone: Manufacturing Copilot

## 🏗️ Capstone Project: The Manufacturing Copilot

Build and deploy a production-ready multi-agent AI system:

The final two weeks are dedicated to the capstone: building and deploying the **Manufacturing Copilot**, a multi-agent AI system designed to solve real-world problems on the factory floor. This project is your opportunity to integrate everything you've learned into a single, impressive portfolio piece.

- 📸 **Vision Agent** - Automated defect detection

- 🔧 **RAG Agent** - Technical documentation Q&A  ### Key Features

- 📝 **Report Agent** - Multi-lingual summaries- 📸 **Visual Quality Inspection:** Use Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automatically detect product defects from images.

- 🤖 **Orchestrator** - LangGraph agent coordinator- 🔧 **Predictive Maintenance Q&A:** Implement a sophisticated RAG system that allows engineers to query maintenance logs and technical manuals.

- 📝 **Automated, Multi-lingual Report Generation:** Fine-tune a model to generate daily production summaries in multiple languages.

**Stack**: FastAPI · PostgreSQL · ChromaDB · Docker · Terraform · GCP  - 🤖 **Agentic Orchestration:** Use LangGraph to create a master agent that delegates tasks to specialized sub-agents, managing complex, multi-step workflows.

**Tests**: 32+ with 85% coverage  

**Deploy**: One command to production### Tech Stack

- **Frameworks:** FastAPI, LangChain, LangGraph

Code in [`capstone_project/`](./capstone_project/) - Ready to ship ✅- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, ChromaDB

- **Deployment:** Docker, Terraform, GitHub Actions

---- **Cloud:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP) - specifically Cloud Run or GKE

- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana

## 🚀 Quick Start

All code for the final project is located in the `capstone_project/` directory. The notebooks in the `week-11-12` module serve as conceptual guides for the implementation within the capstone, providing the theoretical underpinnings for the production code.

### GitHub Codespaces (2 minutes)

```---

1. Click "Code" → "Codespaces" → "Create codespace"

2. Wait 2-3 minutes for environment## 🛠️ Getting Started

3. Open 00_environment_setup.ipynb

4. Start learning!A smooth start is crucial. We've designed the setup process to be as simple as possible, with a strong recommendation for using a cloud-based development environment.

```

### Prerequisites

### Local Setup- Basic understanding of Python programming.

```bash- An active GitHub account.

git clone https://github.com/abhayra12/Gen-AI-Roadmap.git- **Strongly Recommended:** Use GitHub Codespaces for a seamless, pre-configured environment that works right out of the box.

cd Gen-AI-Roadmap

python -m venv venv### Quick Start with GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)

source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate1.  Click the **"Code"** button at the top of the repository page.

pip install -r requirements.txt2.  Select the **"Codespaces"** tab.

```3.  Click **"Create codespace on main"**.

4.  The environment will build automatically in your browser. Once it's ready, VS Code will open.
