## 🎓 Learning Paths

### Path 1: Complete Sequential Build (9-12 hours)
**Best for**: Deep understanding, portfolio project

```
Day 1: START_HERE.md + IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md + Phases 1-4
Day 2: Phases 5-7 (Build all agents)
Day 3: Phases 8-9 (Integration)
Day 4: Phases 10-12 (Testing & Deployment)
```

### Path 2: Core Features Only (4-6 hours)
**Best for**: Quick implementation

```
Phases 1-3 + Phase 6 (RAG Agent) + Phase 8 (LangGraph) + Phase 9 (FastAPI)
Skip: Testing, Docker, Kubernetes (use existing files)
```

### Path 3: Specific Component Learning
**Best for**: Understanding specific technologies

- **Learn RAG?** → Phase 6 in BUILD_FROM_SCRATCH_GUIDE.md
- **Learn LangGraph?** → Phase 8 in BUILD_FROM_SCRATCH_GUIDE_PART2.md
- **Learn Kubernetes?** → Phase 12 in BUILD_FROM_SCRATCH_GUIDE_PART2.md
