                If the CNC machine is overheating during operation:
                1. Immediately stop the machine and allow cooldown (15-20 minutes)
                2. Check coolant levels in the reservoir - refill if below minimum mark
                3. Inspect coolant lines for leaks or blockages
                4. Verify coolant pump is operating (check pressure gauge: should be 40-60 PSI)
                5. Check spindle bearing temperature with IR thermometer (max 65Â°C)
                6. Inspect air filters - replace if clogged
                7. Verify torque settings on all mounting bolts (refer to equipment manual)
                8. If vibration exceeds 5mm/s, escalate to Level-2 maintenance

                Common Welding Defects and Solutions:
                
                WELD POROSITY:
                - Cause: Contaminated base material, improper shielding gas flow
                - Solution: Clean workpiece thoroughly, check gas flow rate (15-20 CFH)
                - Verification: Visual inspection and ultrasonic testing
                
                INCOMPLETE FUSION:
                - Cause: Insufficient heat input, incorrect travel speed
                - Solution: Increase current by 10-15%, reduce travel speed
                - Verification: Destructive testing on sample weld
                
                SPATTER:
                - Cause: Voltage too high, incorrect wire feed speed
                - Solution: Reduce voltage, adjust wire feed to 350-400 IPM
                - Verification: Visual inspection of bead appearance
                
                Safety Note: Always wear proper PPE and ensure adequate ventilation.

                Section 2.1: Component Verification
                
                For assembly line issues involving misalignment or missing components:
                
                MISALIGNMENT DETECTION:
                1. Use precision measurement tools (calipers, micrometers)
                2. Check against blueprint tolerances (Â±0.05mm for critical dimensions)
                3. Verify fixture/jig calibration (monthly calibration required)
                4. Inspect fastener torque specifications (use torque wrench)
                
                MISSING COMPONENT DETECTION:
                1. Implement vision system checkpoint at each assembly station
                2. Manual verification using assembly checklist
                3. Weight verification (assembled unit should be within Â±2% of target)
                
                CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:
                - Misalignment: Rework if within tolerance, scrap if beyond Â±0.1mm
                - Missing component: Return to appropriate assembly station
                - Loose fasteners: Re-torque to specification, use thread locker if repeated issue

                Section 5: Defect Analysis and Remediation
                
                SURFACE DISCOLORATION:
                - Cause: Contamination, improper cure temperature, humidity
                - Solution: 
                  * Strip coating if discoloration affects >10% of surface
                  * Re-prepare surface: degrease, sand (120-grit), clean with solvent
                  * Ensure temperature 65-85Â°F and humidity <70% during application
                  * Verify coating thickness with gauge (target: 2-4 mils)
                
                COATING THICKNESS VARIATION:
                - Cause: Inconsistent spray pattern, incorrect gun distance
                - Solution:
                  * Maintain 8-10 inch distance from surface
                  * Use consistent overlap (50% of spray pattern)
                  * Check fluid pressure: 25-30 PSI for optimal atomization
                  * Calibrate spray gun weekly
                
                ORANGE PEEL TEXTURE:
                - Cause: Low air pressure, thick coating application
                - Solution:
                  * Increase atomizing air pressure to 35-40 PSI
                  * Apply thinner coats (1-2 mils per pass)
                  * Reduce fluid viscosity if needed
                  * Sand and recoat if defect is severe
                
                Quality Check: Use glossmeter for finish verification (target: 80-95 GU)
