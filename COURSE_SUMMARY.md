## üéØ Course Structure

This program is a 12-week intensive journey designed to make you a proficient Generative AI engineer. The curriculum is structured into five distinct phases, taking you from foundational concepts to production-grade deployment.

**12 Weeks | 55+ Notebooks | 1 Capstone Project**

- **Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-4):** Python, ML, Deep Learning, and Transformers.
- **Phase 2: LLMs & Advanced NLP (Weeks 5-6):** Prompt Engineering and RAG.
- **Phase 3: Advanced RAG & Agentic AI (Weeks 7-8):** LangChain, LangGraph, and AI Agents.
- **Phase 4: Model Training & Fine-Tuning (Weeks 9-10):** Pre-training, LoRA, and PEFT.
- **Phase 5: Production & Capstone (Weeks 11-12):** MLOps, Deployment, and the final project.
