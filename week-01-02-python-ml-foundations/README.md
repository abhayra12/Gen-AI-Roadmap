# üìñ Week 1-2: Python & Machine Learning Foundations

**Phase 1: Foundations**  
**Goal:** Build a rock-solid foundation in Python programming, data manipulation, and the principles of classical Machine Learning.

---

## üìö Module Overview

Welcome to the start of your Gen AI journey! This foundational module is designed to equip you with the essential, non-negotiable skills required for advanced AI development. Before we can build sophisticated Generative AI models, we must first master the tools used to handle data and build traditional models. This module covers everything from setting up your environment to building and evaluating your first machine learning models with Scikit-learn.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this two-week module, you will be able to:
- ‚úÖ **Set up and manage a professional, reproducible development environment.**
- ‚úÖ **Write clean, efficient, and "Pythonic" code** by mastering core data structures, functions, and object-oriented principles.
- ‚úÖ **Manipulate and analyze large datasets at scale** using the power of NumPy for numerical operations and Pandas for structured data.
- ‚úÖ **Create insightful and compelling data visualizations** to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- ‚úÖ **Understand and implement the complete end-to-end classical ML workflow**, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, using Scikit-learn.

## üìù Homework: Manufacturing Quality Analysis

**Objective:** Apply your newly acquired skills to a practical, industry-relevant problem.

**Task:**
You will analyze a dataset from a manufacturing process to predict product quality. Your assignment is to perform a full Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), preprocess the data, train several classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest), and write a report summarizing your findings and recommending the best model.

- **Dataset:** Located at `data/manufacturing_quality.csv`
- **Instructions:** See the `HOMEWORK.md` file in this directory for detailed instructions, the dataset schema, and the submission rubric.

## üéØ What's Next?

Once you have mastered these fundamental concepts, you will be fully prepared to tackle **Week 3-4: Deep Learning & NLP Foundations**. In the next module, you will transition from classical ML to the world of neural networks, where you'll explore the revolutionary Transformer architecture that powers modern Large Language Models.

**Let's begin by building a strong foundation!** üöÄ
