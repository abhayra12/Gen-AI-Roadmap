## 📝 Homework: Manufacturing Quality Analysis

**Objective:** Apply your new skills to a practical problem.

**Task:**
Analyze a manufacturing dataset to predict product quality. Your task is to perform a full EDA, preprocess the data, train several classification models, and report your findings.

- **Dataset:** `datasets/manufacturing/quality_data.csv`
- **Instructions:** See the `HOMEWORK.md` file in this directory for detailed instructions and the submission rubric.
