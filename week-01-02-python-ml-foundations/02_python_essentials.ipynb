    "1.  **Core Data Structures**: Master the use of lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples for storing and organizing data.\n",
    "2.  **Control Flow**: Implement sophisticated logic using `if/else` statements, loops, and highly efficient comprehensions.\n",
    "3.  **Modular Code**: Write clean, reusable, and maintainable code with functions and lambda expressions.\n",
    "4.  **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Structure your code effectively with classes, a key skill for building complex systems like model training pipelines.\n",
    "5.  **Robustness and I/O**: Learn to handle files for data loading/saving and manage potential errors gracefully with exception handling.\n",

    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing this intensive review of essential Python concepts! You have revisited and reinforced the fundamental skills that are absolutely critical for building sophisticated and robust Generative AI applications. A deep understanding of these topics separates a hobbyist from a professional AI engineer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Concepts Mastered:\n",
    "-   **Data Structures**: You are now proficient with lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples, and you have a clear understanding of when to use each one for maximum efficiency. You can write clean, efficient list and dictionary comprehensions to transform and filter data.\n",
    "-   **Control Flow**: You can confidently use `if/elif/else` statements and `for/while` loops to direct the logic of your programs, from simple decision-making to complex training loops.\n",
    "-   **Functions & Lambdas**: You can write modular, reusable functions with clear type hints and docstrings, making your code more maintainable and easier to debug. You know how and when to use lambda functions for concise, on-the-fly operations.\n",
    "-   **Object-Oriented Programming**: You understand how to structure complex systems using classes and dataclasses, encapsulating data and behavior into logical, reusable units like models, data loaders, and trainers.\n",
    "-   **Pythonic Best Practices**: You can write robust code that handles errors gracefully using `try...except` blocks, manages resources safely with context managers (`with` statements), and leverages advanced features like decorators to add functionality cleanly.\n",
    "\n",

    "### üìö Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "With your Python foundations solidified, you are now fully prepared to move on to the specialized libraries that form the backbone of data science and machine learning in Python. The skills you've honed in this notebook will be applied in every subsequent module of this program.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <h3>Great job! You're ready for the next step in your AI journey.</h3>\n",
    "    <p>The next notebook in this module will cover <strong>NumPy and Pandas</strong>, the essential libraries for high-performance numerical computing and data manipulation. Get ready to work with large datasets efficiently!</p>\n",
