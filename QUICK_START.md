## üöÄ The 5-Minute Setup (Recommended)

The entire course is designed to run seamlessly on **GitHub Codespaces**, which provides a powerful, pre-configured cloud development environment.

### Steps:
1. **Open in Codespaces:**
   - Click the green **`< > Code`** button on the repository's main page.
   - Go to the **`Codespaces`** tab and click **`Create codespace on main`**.
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for the environment to build.

2. **Set Your Hugging Face Token:**
   - In your repository settings, navigate to **`Secrets and variables` > `Codespaces`**.
   - Create a new secret named `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` and add your [Hugging Face 'read' token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

3. **Start Learning:**
   - Open the `00_environment_setup.ipynb` notebook.
   - Run the cells to verify your setup.

You are now ready to begin the course. All dependencies are pre-installed and configured.
