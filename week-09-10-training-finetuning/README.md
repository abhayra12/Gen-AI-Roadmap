# üìñ Week 9-10: Training & Fine-Tuning

**Phase 5: Training & Fine-tuning**  
**Goal:** Learn to train, fine-tune, and evaluate LLMs to adapt them for specialized tasks.

---

## üìö Module Overview

In this module, you will go under the hood of LLMs to understand how they are trained and how you can customize them. You will start by building a simple language model from scratch to grasp the core mechanics. Then, you will master powerful and efficient fine-tuning techniques (PEFT, LoRA, QLoRA) to specialize pre-trained models for domain-specific tasks without the need for massive computational resources.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- ‚úÖ Understand the fundamental concepts of model pre-training.
- ‚úÖ Build a simple language model and its training loop from scratch using PyTorch.
- ‚úÖ Know when to use fine-tuning versus RAG for a given problem.
- ‚úÖ Implement Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA and QLoRA.
- ‚úÖ Fine-tune a powerful open-source LLM on a custom dataset.
- ‚úÖ Establish a robust framework for evaluating the performance of your fine-tuned model.

## üìù Homework: Fine-Tune for Maintenance Ticket Classification

**Objective:** Specialize an LLM to understand and classify maintenance requests.

**Task:**
You will use a provided dataset of maintenance tickets to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM. The goal is to create a model that can accurately classify new tickets into categories like `Mechanical`, `Electrical`, or `Software`, enabling automated routing.

- **Instructions:** See the `HOMEWORK.md` file in this directory for detailed instructions.

## üéØ What's Next?

You have now covered the full spectrum of creating and customizing AI models. You are ready for the final and most critical phase: **Week 11-12: Production & Deployment**. In this capstone module, you will take everything you've learned and build a single, production-grade, end-to-end AI application.

**Time to forge your own models!** üî•
