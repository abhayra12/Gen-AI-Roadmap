    "### The Heart of RAG: Turning Meaning into Math\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this module, we've built a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. We've seen how it can fetch relevant documents from a knowledge base to provide accurate, context-aware answers. But how does the \"retrieval\" part actually work? How does a computer understand which documents are \"relevant\" to a user's question?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer lies in **Vector Embeddings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector embeddings are the silent engine at the heart of modern semantic search. They are a way of converting the rich, nuanced meaning of text into a universal, mathematical format—a list of numbers called a vector. This process allows us to plot words, sentences, and entire documents in a high-dimensional \"meaning space,\" where similar concepts are located close to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will pull back the curtain on this fascinating technology. We will move beyond using embeddings as a black box and explore:\n",
    "- What are they, intuitively?\n",
    "- How do we generate them?\n",
    "- How can we measure their similarity?\n",
    "- How can we visualize their relationships?\n",
    "- And most importantly, how do we know if our embeddings are any good?\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding embeddings is the final and most crucial step to mastering RAG. Let's begin."

    "By the end of this notebook, you will have a deep, intuitive understanding of the technology that powers semantic search. You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Explain Vector Embeddings Intuitively:** Articulate what an embedding is and how it captures the semantic \"meaning\" of text in a mathematical form.\n",
    "2.  **Generate and Compare Embeddings:** Use a state-of-the-art `sentence-transformers` model to convert text into high-dimensional vectors and measure their similarity using cosine distance.\n",
    "3.  **Visualize the \"Meaning Space\":** Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of embeddings and create 2D scatter plots that visually demonstrate how the model organizes information.\n",
    "4.  **Implement a Basic Embedding Evaluation:** Build a simple but effective \"hit-rate\" evaluation to measure how well your embedding model retrieves relevant documents for a given query, a critical practice for any production RAG system."

    "\n",
    "So, what *is* an embedding?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a vast, multi-dimensional space—let's call it the \"meaning space.\" An embedding model is a sophisticated neural network trained on billions of sentences. Its job is to read a piece of text and place it as a single point (a vector) within this space. The model's key breakthrough is that it learns to arrange these points based on **semantic meaning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Texts with similar meanings are placed close together.\n",
    "-   Texts with different meanings are placed far apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple principle is what enables a computer to \"understand\" context. When a user asks a question, we can embed their query into the same space and simply look for the document vectors that are its nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see this in action. We'll create a small, representative knowledge base for our manufacturing use case and then use a pre-trained `SentenceTransformer` model to convert each document into a vector. We will use `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, a popular and highly efficient model that balances performance and size. It creates vectors with **384 dimensions**. While we can't visualize 384 dimensions directly, we can work with them mathematically."

    "    -   Notice the bright square where the two `maintenance` documents intersect (**0.53**). The model correctly identified that \"changing hydraulic oil\" and \"inspecting a conveyor belt\" are related maintenance activities.\n",
    "    -   Similarly, the two `incident` reports have a high similarity score (**0.62**), as they both describe unexpected events (\"machine stall\" and \"unusual vibrations\").\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Low Similarity (Dark Squares):**\n",
    "    -   The `safety` document has very low similarity to the `quality` document (**0.11**). This makes sense; a lockout-tagout procedure is conceptually very different from a part defect inspection.\n",
