    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first notebook of the Deep Learning & NLP phase! This is where we transition from classical machine learning models to the powerful world of **neural networks**. This notebook lays the essential groundwork for understanding all subsequent deep learning architectures, including the Transformers that power modern Generative AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will have a solid, hands-on understanding of:\n",
    "1.  **Core Neural Network Components**: You will grasp the fundamental architecture of a neural network, including the roles of **neurons**, **layers**, **weights**, and **biases**.\n",
    "2.  **The Training Mechanism**: You will master the key processes that allow a network to learn: **forward propagation** (making a prediction), **backpropagation** (calculating the error gradient), and **gradient descent** (updating the weights).\n",
    "3.  **The Role of Activation Functions**: You will understand why non-linearity is crucial for learning complex patterns and implement key activation functions like **Sigmoid**, **Tanh**, and the ubiquitous **ReLU**.\n",
    "4.  **Building Networks with PyTorch**: You will learn to construct a neural network from scratch using PyTorch's elegant and powerful `nn.Module` class.\n",
    "5.  **End-to-End Training Workflow**: You will go through the complete cycle of defining a model, preparing data, training the model, calculating its loss, and evaluating its performance on both simple and complex datasets.\n",

    "## 📚 What are Neural Networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are a class of machine learning models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They form the backbone of modern **deep learning** and are the engine behind the recent breakthroughs in Generative AI. Their power lies in their ability to automatically learn complex, non-linear patterns and representations directly from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "-   **🔵 Neurons (or Nodes)**: The most fundamental computational units. Each neuron receives inputs, processes them, and passes the result to the next layer.\n",
    "-   **🔗 Layers**: Neurons are organized into layers. A typical network has an **Input Layer** (which receives the raw data), one or more **Hidden Layers** (where the majority of the computation happens), and an **Output Layer** (which produces the final prediction).\n",
    "-   **⚡ Weights & Biases**: These are the **learnable parameters** of the network. The entire training process is about finding the optimal values for these weights and biases to minimize the prediction error.\n",
    "-   **🎯 Activation Functions**: Mathematical functions (like ReLU) applied to the output of each neuron. They introduce essential **non-linearity**, allowing the network to learn far more complex relationships than a simple linear model.\n",
    "-   **📉 Loss Function**: A function that quantifies how wrong the model's predictions are compared to the actual ground truth. The goal of training is to minimize this function.\n",
    "-   **🔄 Optimizer**: An algorithm (e.g., Adam, SGD) that updates the network's weights and biases based on the gradients computed during backpropagation. Its job is to navigate the \"loss landscape\" to find the point of minimum loss.\n",

    "## 2️⃣ Activation Functions: Introducing Non-Linearity\n",

    "Without a non-linear activation function, a neural network, no matter how many layers it has, would behave just like a single-layer linear model. Each layer would just be performing a linear transformation (matrix multiplication). A series of linear transformations can be collapsed into a single, equivalent linear transformation. This means the network would only be able to learn linear relationships in the data, which is far too restrictive for complex, real-world problems like image recognition or natural language understanding.\n",

    "## 6️⃣ Visualizing the Decision Boundary\n",
    "\n",
    "A **decision boundary** is a hypersurface that partitions the underlying vector space into two or more sets, one for each class. In simpler terms, it's the line or surface that the model \"learns\" to separate the different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizing the decision boundary is an excellent way to understand *how* the model is making its decisions and to intuitively assess its performance. For our non-linear, circular dataset, we hope to see a circular or near-circular boundary that correctly separates the green \"non-defective\" points from the red \"defective\" points. A linear model would only be able to draw a straight line, which would fail miserably at this task.\n",
