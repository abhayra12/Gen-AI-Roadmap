    - Accuracy: $\text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}$
    - Precision: $\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}$
    - Recall: $\text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}$
    - F1-Score: $\text{F1} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}$
  - When to use each metric
