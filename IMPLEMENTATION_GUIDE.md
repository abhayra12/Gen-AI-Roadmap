## 📋 Recommended Next Steps

### Step 1: Review What's Created (Today)
1. ✅ Read README.md thoroughly
2. ✅ Go through GETTING_STARTED.md
3. ✅ Check CAPSTONE_PROJECT.md
4. ✅ Review COURSE_SUMMARY.md
5. ✅ Familiarize with structure

### Step 2: Setup Environment (Day 1)
1. Create GitHub Codespace
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure HuggingFace token
4. Verify setup with `00_environment_setup.ipynb`

### Step 3: Start Learning (Week 1)
1. Read Week 1-2 README
2. Complete `01_environment_setup.ipynb`
3. Work through `02_python_essentials.ipynb`
4. Continue with remaining notebooks

### Step 4: Create Remaining Notebooks (As You Learn)
Since creating all 55 notebooks upfront would be overwhelming, I recommend:

**Option A: Create as you learn**
- When you reach a week, create those notebooks
- Reference official documentation
- Add your own notes and examples

**Option B: Use templates**
Each notebook should follow this structure:
```markdown
# Notebook Title
## Objectives
## Theory/Concepts
## Code Examples
## Exercises
## Summary
## Next Steps
```

### Step 5: Build Capstone (Week 11-12)
Follow the detailed CAPSTONE_PROJECT.md roadmap

- Practice exercises
- External resources

This is intentionally left for you to:
1. Learn by creating content
2. Reference official docs
3. Add your own insights
4. Customize to your needs

### About Datasets
You'll need to:
- Create or find sample datasets
- Add to `datasets/` directory
- Document data sources
- Provide data dictionaries

### About the Capstone
The roadmap is complete, but you'll:
- Implement each phase
- Write the actual code
- Deploy to GCP
- Document everything
