    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Design Multi-Environment Workflows:** Create separate GitHub Actions workflows for Continuous Integration (`ci.yml`) and Deployment (`deploy.yml`).\n",
    "- **Implement Quality Gates:** Integrate automated checks into the CI pipeline, including unit tests, container vulnerability scans, and custom \"prompt linting.\"\n",
    "- **Automate Staging Deployment:** Configure the pipeline to automatically deploy the application to a staging environment after a pull request is merged.\n",
    "- **Gate Production Deployment:** Implement a manual approval step in the workflow to ensure that a human reviews and authorizes any deployment to the production environment.\n",
    "- **Collect Audit Evidence:** Create a script to automatically gather and archive release artifacts (like test results and scan reports) for compliance and auditing purposes.\n"

    "## 🧩 Scenario: A Safe and Auditable Path to Production\n",
    "\n",
    "The development team for the Manufacturing Copilot is ready to automate their release process. The company's release policy is strict and designed to prevent outages and ensure compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Policy:**\n",
    "1.  **Pull Request (PR) Checks:** No code can be merged into the `main` branch unless it passes all automated quality and security checks.\n",
    "2.  **Automatic Staging Deployment:** Once a PR is merged to `main`, the new version must be automatically deployed to a `staging` environment for final testing.\n",
    "3.  **Manual Production Approval:** Deployment to `production` is not automatic. A designated approver (e.g., the Head of Maintenance) must give explicit approval within the GitHub Actions workflow. This approval must be linked to a change management ticket.\n",
    "4.  **Evidence Archiving:** All artifacts related to a release (test results, scan reports, approver's name) must be archived for future audits.\n"

    "### 🔧 `ci.yml` (The Quality Gate)\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow runs on every pull request targeting the `main` branch. It acts as a \"quality gate,\" preventing low-quality or insecure code from being merged. We'll use a combination of tools to ensure code correctness, style, and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- **Path Filtering:** The workflow only runs when relevant files (`app/`, `tests/`, `prompts/`) are changed, saving CI minutes.\n",
    "- **Dependency Caching:** Caches Poetry dependencies to speed up subsequent runs.\n",
    "- **Linting & Formatting:** Uses `ruff` for high-speed linting and format checking.\n",
    "- **Unit Testing:** Runs the `pytest` suite.\n",
    "- **Static Analysis:** Integrates **CodeQL** to find potential security vulnerabilities in the Python code. This is a critical step for writing secure applications.\n",

    "    -   Enable \"Require status checks to pass before merging.\"\n",
