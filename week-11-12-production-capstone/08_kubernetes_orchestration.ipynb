    "\n",
    "- **Package with Helm:** Use Helm, the Kubernetes package manager, to create a reusable and configurable chart for deploying the copilot application.\n",
    "- **Configure Advanced Autoscaling:** Implement the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to automatically scale the number of application pods based on CPU utilization or custom metrics.\n",
    "- **Implement Canary Rollouts:** Use a progressive delivery controller like Argo Rollouts to safely release new versions by gradually shifting traffic and running automated analysis.\n",
    "- **Secure with a Service Mesh:** Introduce Anthos Service Mesh (ASM) or Istio to enforce mutual TLS (mTLS) for secure pod-to-pod communication and to gain deep traffic telemetry.\n"

    "## 🧩 Scenario: High-Availability, Multi-Service Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "As the Manufacturing Copilot becomes business-critical, the requirements for its deployment have become more stringent. Cloud Run is excellent, but the operations team needs more control.\n",
    "\n",
    "**New Requirements:**\n",
    "1.  **Complex Service Topologies:** The application is no longer a single container. It now includes a sidecar container for real-time retrieval, which must be deployed alongside the main API container in the same pod.\n",
    "2.  **Zero-Downtime, Risk-Managed Rollouts:** New versions must be rolled out to a small subset of users first (a \"canary\" release). The system must automatically monitor key metrics (like hallucination rate) and roll back if they degrade.\n",
    "3.  **Strict Security:** All network traffic *between* services inside the Kubernetes cluster must be encrypted (mTLS).\n",
    "4.  **Cost-Effective Scaling:** The application must scale based on real-time demand, but the team also needs to prevent service disruption during voluntary maintenance (e.g., node upgrades), which requires a `PodDisruptionBudget`.\n"
