    "Before this API can go into production, the following items must be addressed. This is a crucial step in the MLOps lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   [ ] **Dependency Management:** All Python dependencies are pinned in a `requirements.txt` file for reproducible builds.\n",
    "-   [ ] **Configuration Management:** All hardcoded values (like model names or thresholds) are moved to a configuration file or environment variables.\n",
    "-   [ ] **Security:** HTTPS is enabled at the load balancer level (e.g., using GCP Cloud Run's managed certificates).\n",
    "-   [ ] **IAM & Permissions:** The service runs under a dedicated service account with the minimum required permissions (e.g., read-only access to model buckets).\n",
    "-   [ ] **Logging & Auditing:** Structured logs (JSON format) are enabled and configured to be stored for a required retention period (e.g., 7 years for compliance).\n",
    "-   [ ] **Secrets Management:** All sensitive values (API keys, database URLs) are loaded from a secure secret manager (like GCP Secret Manager) and not stored in code.\n"

    "## ðŸ§ª Lab Assignment: Enhance the API\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Add a Health Check Endpoint:**\n",
    "    -   Create a new endpoint at `/health` that returns a simple JSON response like `{\"status\": \"ok\"}` with a 200 status code. This is essential for production monitoring systems to know if your service is alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Implement Streaming Response:**\n",
    "    -   The RAG agent might take a few seconds to generate a detailed response. To improve user experience, modify the `/v1/diagnose` endpoint to stream the response.\n",
    "    -   Use `fastapi.responses.StreamingResponse` and a generator function (`async def`) to `yield` parts of the response as they become available (e.g., yield the vision analysis first, then stream the RAG steps one by one).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Perform Load Testing:**\n",
    "    -   Install a load testing tool like `locust` (`pip install locust`).\n",
    "    -   Write a simple `locustfile.py` to send requests to your `/v1/diagnose` endpoint.\n",
    "    -   Run a test with 50 concurrent users and analyze the results. Does the response time stay within your 500ms SLA?\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Draft an API SLA Document:**\n",
    "    -   Create a markdown file (`API_SLA.md`) that defines the service level agreement for your API. Include:\n",
    "        -   **Uptime Commitment:** e.g., 99.9%\n",
    "        -   **Latency Commitment:** e.g., P95 response time < 500ms\n",
    "        -   **Support:** How to report issues.\n",
    "        -   **Exclusions:** What conditions are not covered (e.g., downstream system failures).\n"
