# üìù Homework Assignment - Week 11-12: The Manufacturing Copilot Capstone

**Module:** Production Deployment & Capstone Project  
**Due:** End of Week 12  
**Points:** 200 (This is your final project and grade)

---

## üéØ Assignment: Build and Deploy the Manufacturing Copilot

This is your final assignment: to build, test, and deploy a production-grade version of the **Manufacturing Copilot**. You will integrate all the skills you've learned throughout this course‚Äîfrom MLOps and FastAPI to Docker, Terraform, and Kubernetes‚Äîinto a single, comprehensive application.

Refer to the main **[CAPSTONE_PROJECT.md](../CAPSTONE_PROJECT.md)** file for the complete, detailed implementation guide.

## üè≠ Project Overview

**Title:** The Manufacturing Copilot

**Description:** A multi-agent AI system designed for the factory floor that:
-   Performs **visual quality inspection** on parts using a vision model.
-   Provides **maintenance Q&A** by retrieving information from technical documents (RAG).
-   Generates **structured reports** in multiple languages using a fine-tuned model.
-   **Orchestrates** these skills into complex workflows using LangGraph.

**Real-World Impact:** This tool is designed to reduce manufacturing defects, decrease machine downtime, and provide critical support for factory floor technicians.

## üìä Project Requirements

### Core Application Features (Must-Have)
1.  **Vision Agent:** Detects defects in images of manufactured parts.
2.  **RAG Agent:** Answers questions based on a knowledge base of SOPs and manuals.
3.  **Report Generation Agent:** Creates multi-lingual summaries and reports.
4.  **Agent Orchestration:** A LangGraph workflow that routes tasks to the correct agent.
5.  **REST API:** A robust FastAPI application to expose the copilot's functionality.
6.  **Database:** PostgreSQL for structured data and ChromaDB for vector storage.

### Production & MLOps Features (Must-Have)
1.  **Docker:** A multi-stage `Dockerfile` for containerizing the FastAPI application.
2.  **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform scripts to provision all necessary GCP resources.
3.  **CI/CD Pipeline:** A GitHub Actions workflow that automatically tests and deploys the application.
4.  **Cloud Deployment:** The application must be live and accessible on GCP Cloud Run.
5.  **Monitoring & Logging:** Prometheus metrics and structured logs to monitor application health.
6.  **Testing:** A suite of unit and integration tests with good coverage.

## üìã High-Level Implementation Plan

This is a two-week intensive project. Manage your time carefully.

### Week 11: Core Application Development
-   **Days 1-2: Foundation & Architecture:** Set up your project structure, database schemas, and overall application design.
-   **Days 3-4: RAG Agent Implementation:** Build the document processing pipeline, set up the vector database, and create the Q&A agent.
-   **Days 5-6: Vision & Report Agents:** Integrate the vision model for defect detection and the fine-tuned model for report generation.
-   **Day 7: Agent Orchestration:** Build the main LangGraph workflow that connects all the agents.

### Week 12: Deployment & Productionalization
-   **Days 8-9: API Development & Containerization:** Build the FastAPI endpoints and create the `Dockerfile`.
-   **Days 10-11: Infrastructure as Code:** Write the Terraform scripts to define your GCP infrastructure.
-   **Day 12: CI/CD Pipeline:** Create the GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and deployment.
-   **Day 13: Deployment & Monitoring:** Deploy the application to GCP, set up monitoring dashboards, and conduct load testing.
-   **Day 14: Final Touches & Presentation Prep:** Finalize your documentation, record your demo video, and prepare for your presentation.
