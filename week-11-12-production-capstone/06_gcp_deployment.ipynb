    "- **Deploy to Cloud Run:** Configure and deploy our Docker container to Cloud Run, a serverless platform, enabling automatic scaling, version management, and HTTPS endpoints.\n",
    "- **Manage Secrets Securely:** Use Google Secret Manager to store and securely inject sensitive data (like API keys and database passwords) into the running container.\n",
    "- **Automate with Deployment Scripts:** Write Python scripts that use the `gcloud` CLI to automate and standardize the deployment process across different environments (staging, production).\n",
    "- **Implement Event-Driven Error Notifications:** Set up a pipeline using Cloud Logging, Pub/Sub, and Cloud Functions to automatically send notifications to a Teams channel or PagerDuty when errors occur.\n"

    "## üß© Scenario: A Scalable, Multi-Region Copilot Service\n",
    "\n",
    "The Manufacturing Copilot is a global success, and it needs to be deployed in multiple regions to serve plants in India (`asia-south1`) and Mexico (`us-central1`) with low latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Architecture Requirements:**\n",
    "1.  **Primary Service:** The main FastAPI application will be deployed on **Cloud Run**. It must scale automatically based on traffic, from zero to a configured maximum.\n",
    "2.  **Asynchronous Processing:** User feedback (e.g., ratings on a RAG response) will be handled by a separate, lightweight **Cloud Function** that ingests the feedback and stores it in BigQuery without blocking the main application.\n",
    "3.  **Secure Configuration:** All prompts will be stored centrally in a Cloud Storage bucket, and all secrets (API keys, etc.) will be managed by Google Secret Manager.\n",
    "4.  **Private Networking:** The Cloud Run service needs to access an on-premises database, so it must be connected to a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that is linked to the factory network via Cloud VPN.\n"
